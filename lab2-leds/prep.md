   | **LED color** | **Supply voltage** | **LED current** | **LED voltage** | **Resistor value** |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   | red | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | 2&nbsp;V | 150&nbsp;ohm |
   | green | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA  | 2.2&nbsp;V | 140&nbsp;ohm |
   | blue | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | 3.3&nbsp;V | 85&nbsp;ohm|
